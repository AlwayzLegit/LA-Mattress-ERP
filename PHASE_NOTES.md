# PHASE_NOTES — dashboard & register redesign

Running log for the 12-phase redesign in `design_handoff_redesign_12_phases/`
(`README.md` there is the spec, `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md` the phase plan). One entry per
phase: what changed, what was assumed, and a **Later** list for ideas that lost to a
locked decision. The consolidated Later list and the answers to README §5 land in the
Phase 12 entry.

## Phase 1 — Tokens and fonts (2026-09-12)

**Branch:** `claude/new-session-q4kc7l` · **Scope:** `apps/web` only, no schema, no API.

### What changed

- **Fonts.** Public Sans (400–600), Archivo (500–700) and JetBrains Mono (400–500) are
  self-hosted variable woff2 files under `apps/web/public/fonts/` (latin + latin-ext,
  Google Fonts v21 / v25 / v24 slices), declared with `@font-face` in `globals.css`. Geist
  and Geist Mono are removed. Self-hosting rather than `next/font` keeps the existing
  pattern (no third-party stylesheet, register still has its type when the store is
  offline). Body is Public Sans 13px / 1.5; `h1`–`h4` are Archivo with tabular figures;
  `--font-mono` is JetBrains Mono. Type-scale classes `t-display-xl`, `t-display-l`,
  `t-heading`, `t-title`, `t-body`, `t-body-register`, `t-label`, `t-mono`, `t-mono-sm`
  mirror canvas 2d.
- **Colour.** `:root` now carries the README §1 ramp verbatim (`--bg #f6f5f2`,
  `--surface`, `--surface-2`, `--border`, `--border-strong`, `--text`, `--text-2`,
  `--muted`, `--faint`, `--accent #1e3a5f`, `--accent-soft`, `--accent-ink`) and the six
  status triplets as `--status-{draft|waiting|scheduled|fulfilled|cancelled|risk}-{fg|bg|border}`.
  `--destructive` aliases the risk red for the outlined destructive tier. Every legacy name
  (`--brand`, `--danger`, `--warn`, `--info`, `--success`, `--surface2`, `--text2`,
  `--border2`, `--neutral-soft`, …) is an alias onto the new ramp so the ~1,000 existing
  call sites pick it up unchanged. The Tailwind `@theme` block maps both the new names
  (`bg-surface-2`, `text-text-2`, `text-muted`, `border-border-strong`, `bg-accent-soft`,
  `text-status-risk`, `font-display`) and the legacy utilities still in the tree.
  The green oklch accent, the dark theme block and every hard-coded Tailwind hex in
  `globals.css` (alerts, password-strength bar, sonner override, auth radial gradients)
  are gone; those now read status tokens.
- **Radius.** `--radius-chip 3`, `--radius-input 3`, `--radius-control 3`,
  `--radius-button 5`, `--radius-card 5`, `--radius-sheet 0`; legacy `--radius` → 5 and
  `--radius-sm` → 3. Every `border-radius` in `globals.css` reads one of these (tables,
  table wraps and header corners are now square; pills/badges/kbd/count chips are 3;
  buttons, menus, dialogs, panels, KPI strips and the auth card are 5). Only bars (2px
  meters) and true circles (dots, avatars) keep literal values. No 9px remains.
- **Density.** Two presets as data attributes: `:root` / `[data-density="management"]`
  (row 36 · text 13 · control 30) and `[data-density="register"]` (row 44 · text 14 ·
  control 38 · hit target 44), exposed as `--row-h`, `--text-size`, `--control-h`,
  `--hit-target`; the legacy `--rowy` / `--pad` / `--kpi` derive from the preset. The
  register opts in on its root in Phase 4.
- **Focus.** Global `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px }`
  with no radius; the four `outline: none` rules in `globals.css` and the two inline ones
  (command palette input, global search input) are removed. Inputs show the accent border
  on focus and `--border-strong` on hover instead of a box-shadow halo.
- **Motion.** `--motion 120ms ease-out`, `--motion-slide 160ms`. Under
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` every animation and transition is 0 and the skeleton
  shimmer becomes a static two-tone bar.
- **Light mode only.** The per-user theme (light/dark) and density (cozy/compact)
  preferences are removed: `lib/ui-prefs.ts`, the root-layout bootstrap script, the
  Theme / Density segment in the account menu, and the `T` shortcut (and its row in the
  shortcuts dialog). Stored `jetnine.theme` / `jetnine.density` localStorage keys are
  simply ignored.
- **Primary and destructive buttons** now match the tier rule: primary is accent-filled
  (was ink-on-paper), destructive is outlined risk red on white (was grey-bordered).
  Active filter pills are accent-filled.
- **`/dev/tokens`** renders artboard 2d from the live CSS variables: type scale, neutral
  ramp, accent, destructive tier, six status chips with contrast ratios, spacing / radius /
  density / focus / motion, both density presets on a real row + control, and the skeleton.
  `apps/web/src/lib/design-tokens.ts` holds the same literals for code that has to name a
  token (Phase 2 StatusChip, print documents).
- The hand-off folder is checked in at `design_handoff_redesign_12_phases/` (excluded from
  prettier). The `.dc.html` files are references, not shipped routes.

### Assumptions

- "Self-host or next/font": self-hosted, for the offline register.
- Public Sans latin + latin-ext only (as Geist was); Vietnamese / Cyrillic / Greek slices
  are not bundled.
- The user-level density preference is retired in favour of the two surface presets;
  nothing in the spec keeps a per-user compact mode.
- `/dev/tokens` is a plain public route with `robots: noindex` — it has no data and no
  shell. Gate it behind an env flag if the owner prefers.

### Later

- Licensed grotesk (Söhne or similar) replacing Public Sans if the owner buys one (canvas
  2a note); the scale would not change.
- Once Phase 12 deletes the legacy aliases, the `@theme` block shrinks to the new names.
- Tailwind `rounded-*` utilities with off-scale radii still exist in ~13 TSX files (dashboard
  cards, team tasks, agency page); they are restyled with their screens in Phases 3–10.
